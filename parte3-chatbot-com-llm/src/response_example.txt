Chatbot: Based on the provided text, the following information can be deduced:

* The person with work experience using "Wood lath machine" (likely an executive or supervisor) has calculated the risk rating for operating a lathe as 16, which falls into the "High" range.
* To operate a lathe safely, one should:
	+ Wear safety shoes and a lab coat
	+ Wear safety goggles or a face shield
	+ Wear ear muffs to prevent noise exposure
	+ Wear a dust mask when generating dust
	+ Not wear gloves during operation ( likely because gloves may interfere with handling the tools)
* Additionally, some operational precautions are mentioned:
	+ Ensure all clamps and fittings are secure before turning on the lathe
	+ Use workpieces free of defects
	+ Hold tools firmly with both hands against the tool rest
	+ Securely hold stock on the faceplate or between centers
	+ Use sharp, well-maintained chisels and gouges
	+ Select a suitable speed for the job
	+ Operate at a low speed and use moderate cut depth to prevent splinters during roughing operations
	+ Adjust tool rests to be parallel and close to the stock
